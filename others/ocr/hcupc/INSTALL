** Installation information

The './install.sh' script is a convenience build scripts, it ALWAYS
runs the following steps:
    
    - aclocal
    - autoreconf
    - configure
    - make
    - make install

By default the scripts creates a 'compileTree' folder that contains
generated object files and libraries. This is where you can type
'make' or 'make install' directly to bypass all the steps done by the
'install.sh' script.

The default installation folder that contains the final library and
header files is 'ocr-install'. To override the default installation 
folder, set the 'INSTALL_ROOT' environment variable.

    export INSTALL_ROOT=/my/install/folder
