 *     - An event with a data-block is a control+data dependence

 *               satisfied)

 *                an argument and one is given or if the event takes an argument and none
 *                is given
 *
 * An event satisfaction without the optional data-block can be viewed as a pure
 * control dependence whereas one with a data-block is a control+data dependence
 *
 * @note On satisfaction, a OCR_EVENT_ONCE_T event will pass the GUID of the
 * optional attached data-block to all EDTs/Events waiting on it at that time
 * and the event will destroy itself. For OCR_EVENT_IDEM_T and OCR_EVENT_STICKY_T,
