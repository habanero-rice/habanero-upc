# HCLIB Overview

HCLIB is a library version of the Habanero-C language. This distribution contains an implementation of HCLIB built on top of the Open Community Runtime (OCR).

# Getting Started

## Installation

See the `INSTALL` file for detailed installation instructions.

## Running HCLIB non-regression tests

    cd tests;
    ./runTests

# Writing programs using HCLIB

HCLIB defines a C-based interface in the `hclib.h` header file. 
Just use the include directive in your program to import the interface:

    #include "hclib.h"

# Linking with HCLIB

If you have set the `HCLIB_ROOT` and `OCR_ROOT` environment variable as described in the `INSTALL` file, you can define the following environment variables to simplify compiler command line simpler:

	export HCLIB_CFLAGS="-I${HCLIB_ROOT}/include"
	export HCLIB_LDFLAGS="-L${HCLIB_ROOT}/lib -L${OCR_ROOT}/lib -locr -lhclib"

Linking against OCR and HCLIB is then done easily:

    gcc -g ${HCLIB_LDFLAGS} ${HCLIB_CFLAGS} your_program.c
